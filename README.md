# Solve-The-Fucking-Crime

So, this is a DS project from UPRM, Spring 2021. The idea of this project is to make students suffer in the field of 
mathematics and computing so they can change their field. The end :3

Ok no lul. The idea of this project is for us students to apply ADT (Abstract DataTypes) into something.

For all the full details n stuff refer to the pdf our professors upload till i can stop being a fucking procrastinator
and properly document this piece of shit.
