<h3>:shipit: Oh Hello There! </h3>

<p align="center"> This is a Data Structures Project üèó </p>

Solve the Crime is a simple project done by the students taking the course of, well, Data Structures of the University of Puerto Rico, Spring 2021. This project is based upon a story that our Professor gave us. You can refer to the document located at `specifications`

## TL;DR
Our job is to program something that takes a folder full of data, convert it into a 3D matrix, convert that 3D matrix into a multiset, which represents the union of the 3D matrix and finally implement 4 distinct methods which are given (in partial pseudocode). These methods given are ways to obtain a 1D set which represents the intersection of the given multiset, each more efficient than the other. If you want to know more in deph about each method refer to to the doc the prof gave us.

## Ok, so what?
Well, this Set that the program outputs represents the number of events that appear in ALL events T. So, yeah, that's kinda it...
...
...
... Actually no. It turns out there's an optional part of this project, which at the moment this current project does not have. According to the document, each technique to obtain the intersection varies in efficiency, the optinal part of the project was to display a stress run over each technique and plot the data on an excel program like Google Sheets, but again, that is not here, only the non optional

## So... ok, I get it, a college project, cool. But what is the purpose of it?
#### Simple: ~make us suffer~ ü§£

Ok no, just joking. During the course we've been learning different structures like Bags, Stacks, Sets and other structures. In this case we would apply Sets, and the different ways it may be implemeted

## Sounds cool n all, but how can I run this?
* At the moment you could manually compile the java code and run the `Main` wrapper in bash, but it is prefered if its done from an IDE such as [IntelliJ](https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/)
* After the project is compiled move to the directory where `solve.sh` is located
* Then type the following:


```chmod x+ solve.sh```
Then
```./solve.sh --method all -s --path-tester /path/of/stuff```

## TODO üóí
- [ ] Complete Optional Section
