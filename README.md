<h3>:shipit: Oh Hello There! </h3>

<p align="center"> This is a Data Structures Project üèó </p>

Solve the Crime is a simple project done by the students taking the course of, well, Data Structures of the University of Puerto Rico, Spring 2021. This project is based upon a story that our Professor gave us. You can refer to the document located at `specifications`

## TL;DR
Our job is to program something that takes a folder full of data, convert it into a 3D matrix, convert that 3D matrix into a multiset, which represents the union of the 3D matrix and finally implement 4 distinct methods which are given (in partial pseudocode). These methods given are ways to obtain a 1D set which represents the intersection of the given multiset, each more efficient than the other. If you want to know more in deph about each method refer to to the doc the prof gave us.

## Ok, so what?
Well, this Set that the program outputs represents []


## So... ok, I get it, a college project, cool. But what is the purpose of it?


## Sounds cool n all, but how can I run this?



## TODO üóí
